        <h3>Key Of Liberty</h3>
        <h1>All Men Are Created Equal</h1>
        <h2>By Tyler</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The phrase "<bold>all men are created equal</bold>" comes from the Declaration of Independence, written in 1776. It means that every person is important and has the same basic value.</p>
        <p>This phrase does <bold>not</bold> mean that everyone is the same. People have different talents, looks, and abilities. Instead it means that no one is born better than anyone else, and no one is meant to rule over others just because of who they are.</p>
        <p>The Declaration says that all people are born with <bold>natural rights</bold>, such as the right to <bold>life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</bold> These rights belongto everyone, and the government's job is to protect them.</p>
        <p>When this idea was written, it was not true for everyone. Slavery still existed, and women and many others did not have equal rights. Over time, people used the idea that "all men are created equal" to fight for fairness and equal treatment.</p>
        <p>Today, this phrase means that <bold>all people should be treated fairly and with respect</bold>, no matter who they are. It reminds us to stand up for equality and justice.</p>
