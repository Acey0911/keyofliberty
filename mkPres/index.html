            <h2>What is a Natural Right?</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>A natural right is a right given by being human that is superior to government and can not be given nor taken away.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="content nr2">
            <h2>Examples of Natural Rights:</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>An example of a natural right is the right to live. I'm joking, that one's obvious.</p>
                <p>Another example is working together, working as a team can't be taken away.</p>
                <p>And another example is the ability to create, like I created this website and many other things!</p>
                <p>And last example is the right to revolution, to be able to overthrow an unfair or oppressive government.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>My class read this book, it was the entire life story of John Adams.</p>
                <p>He was a very important person in the founding of America.</p>
                <p>Most importantly he was one of the men who used their agency to free America.</p>

            <h2>What I believe:</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>I believe that natural rights are necessary, and do exist because of our devinely given agency from God.</p>
                <p>Man wasn't created to be ruled over, but to learn stuff. Though it's still very useful to have a wise leader, because some leaders don't make smart decisions.</p>
                <p>Natural rights is pretty much what allowed America to become a thing, to become free and to set the base rules for the Declaration of Independence</p>
