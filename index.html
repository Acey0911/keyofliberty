        <h2>What is a Natural Right?</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>A natural right is a right given by being human that is superior to government and can not be given nor taken away.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content nr2">
        <h2>Examples of Natural Rights:</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>An example of a natural right is the right to live. I'm joking, that one's obvious.</p>
            <p>Another example is working together, working as a team can't be taken away.</p>
            <p>And another example is the ability to create.</p>
            <p>And last example is the right to revolution, to be able to overthrow an unfair or oppressive government.</p>

    <div class="content nr3">
        <h2>What I believe:</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I believe that natural rights are necessary, and do exist because of our devinely given agency from God.</p>
            <p>Man wasn't created to rule over, but to learn stuff. But it's still very useful to have a wise leader, because some people are not super smart.</p>
